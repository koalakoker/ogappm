For linux user the step is a little bit complex but we are linux guy and so this is bread for our thoot.

In the Linux folder you can find two file for each version:

ogapp-x.y.z-ubuntu1204.tar.gz (Compiled and tested on Ubuntu 1204)
ogapp-x.y.z-src.tar.gz (Source files)

If the compiled version is not working in your linux distribution you have to compile the executable from the sources. 
Download the last version of ogapp-x.y.z-src.tar.gz and extract it in a working folder.
It is a QT progect so you can open a terminal and type

cd <working folder>

Then you have to prepare the build using 

qmake 

and then build using 

make

To do this probably you need to have the QT and qmake installed. (I'll try to start from a clean installation to verify which package you need to install).
If all goes good the compiled file OGapp will be generated in the working folder.
You can run it from there 

./OGapp 

or you can insall it in in the /usr/bin folder

sudo cp OGapp /usr/bin

And you can start it from anywhere typing 

OGapp
